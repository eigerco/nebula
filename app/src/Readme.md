What is it?
-----------

Nebula is a tool for easing development of Soroban smart contracts being highly cohesive with the existing ecosystem.

Development
-----------

Nebula aims to provide the following functionality:

*   A contract wizard UI, that will help developers to graphically compose smart contracts from templates which are ready for production use and audited.
*   A highly cohesive Soroban Rust contract library, that will contain the contracts that the wizard will use. Developers can also make use of this library interfaces and implementations directly.
*   A contract management system via [`#import`](https://github.com/eigerco/nebula/discussions/11)
