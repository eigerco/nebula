Nebula is a tool for easing development of [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs) smart contracts. Its integrated by a Wizard and a set of pre-coded, community audited smart contracts. 
It aims to play in a cohesive way with the existing [Stellar](https://stellar.org/) ecosystem.

## Status of this project

Progress on this project is currently just a demonstration of the [initial](https://github.com/eigerco/nebula/milestone/1) part of the first milestone, which aims to show the essence and 
interoperability of the tools that are planned to be built:

* The [Nebula's UI](#wizard-ui) wizard.
* The [smart contracts](#contracts).

⚠️ Currently, production usage is discouraged.

## Wizard UI

Currently a live, latest version of the wizard can be found [here](https://eigerco.github.io/nebula/).

The frontend contains some basic starter code.

To run:
```
git clone https://github.com/eigerco/nebula
cd nebula/app
npm install
npm run dev
```

To build for deployment: 
```
npm run build
```
The dist folder will contain the files ready for static serving.

Theres is a "readme" tab in the frontend that better describes the intentionality.

## Contracts

Nebula provides a set of common contracts for speeding up the deployment of certain common operations. 

Contracts are located [here](contracts/) and intended to be used by the [UI wizard](#wizard-ui). They use a trait based 
approach for maximizing the extension/customization of the contracts.

After [installing rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), tests can be run by just:

```bash
$ cd contracts
$ cargo test
```
